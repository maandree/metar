NAME
	metar - Trivial weather report

SYNOPSIS
	metar get
	metar print
	metar set STATION
	metar list [PREFIX]
	metar closest [LATITUDE LONGITUDE] [LIST]

DESCRIPTION
	metar is a simple utility for find whether stations (hence referred to
	as METAR stations,) and get METAR reports. Most METAR stations are
	airports.

ACTIONS
	get
		Gets the most recent weather report from the selected METAR
		station. The first line in the report will contain the station's
		name, country, ICAO station identifier, and location. There are
		however some station there this information is missing.

	print
		Print the ICAO station identifier of the selected METAR station,
		the station from which weather reports are retrieved. This is
		equivalent to running

		(cat ~/.config/metar || cat /etc/metar) 2> /dev/null | head -n 1

	set STATION
		Stores the STATION as the METAR station from which weather
		reports shall be retrieved. STATION shall be the stations's
		ICAO station identifier. This is equivalent to running

		echo STATION > ~/.config/metar

	list [PREFIX]
		Print all METAR stations. This can take a very long time. You
		are strongly encouraged to store the output to a file. For a,
		not as good, list you can look at
		http://www.aviationweather.gov/static/adds/metars/stations.txt

		To speed up the listing process, you can filter the output
		by select the PREFIX of the ICAO station identifiers. If you
		look at the page with the URL above, you will find the prefix
		for your country. PREFIX may be a regular expression. These
		regular expressions are listed in
		<https://github.com/maandree/metar/blob/master/prefixes>.
		Note however, this list is not guaranteed to be up to date.

		Each station is will be printed on a line, containing the its
		name, country, ICAO station identifier, and location. The
		ICAO station identifier is in parenthesis.

	closest [LATITUDE LONGITUDE] [LIST]
		Given a LATITUDE and LONGITUDE in decimal format, print the
		ICAO station identifier of the closest METAR station. If you
		have already created a list of all stations using the action
		list, specify the filename of that list as the LIST argument.
		If LATITUDE and LONGITUDE are omitted, ~/.config/geolocation,
		or /etc/geolocation, is used.

FILES
	~/.config/metar
		Contains the ICAO station identifier for the selected weather
		station, and nothing else, except an LF at the end. This will
		never change. Other programs are encouraged to use this file
		too.

		If the file contains more than one line, only the first line,
		even if it is empty, is used.

	/etc/metar
		Fallback file use if ~/.config/metar is missing. Other
		programs are encouraged to use this file too.

	~/.config/geolocation
		Used to get your location in case 'metar closest' is invoked
		without LATITUDE and LONGITUDE. This file contains your
		geographical location using the Global Positioning System in
		decimal format. This will never change. Other programs are
		encouraged to use this file too.

		If the file contains more than one line, only the first line,
		even if it is empty, is used.

	/etc/geolocation
		Fallback file use if ~/.config/geolocation is missing. Other
		programs are encouraged to use this file too.

NOTES
	US Americans, remember, you are on the Western Hemisphere. Therefore,
	you should specify a negative longitude when using the action closest.
